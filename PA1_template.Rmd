## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
zipfile <- "activity.zip"
infile <- "activity.csv"
if (!file.exists(infile)) {
    unzip(zipfile)
}

data <- read.csv(infile, colClasses=c(NA, 'Date', NA))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(plyr)
steps_per_day <- ddply(data, .(date), summarize, total=sum(steps))
hist(steps_per_day$total,
     breaks = 10,
     main = "Total steps per day",
     xlab = "Number of Steps")
mean_steps_per_day <- mean(steps_per_day$total, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps_per_day <- median(steps_per_day$total, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean and median total number of steps each day are:

- Mean: `r as.integer(mean_steps_per_day)`
- Median: `r as.integer(median_steps_per_day)`

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
